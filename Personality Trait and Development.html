		<p style = "text-align:center">I truly believe that this assessment has it's validity because, I'm the type of person  who is straight forward, get to the point kind of person, easy going and humble. I'm a naturally calm person in certain situations.II'm very supportive when it comes down to my friends’ many needs and wants. I'm normally described as good team player. I'm also grreat at multi-tasking and making sure the work is done on time. I can easily get lost in helping people so sometimes, I lose sight of what’s really important and its the task at hand. I try to avoid arguments and conflicts but I'm a patient person. I think more people should be like me.</p>
