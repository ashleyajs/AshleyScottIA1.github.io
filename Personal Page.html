		<h4 style = "color:white">If I have anxiety, I often feel as if something bad is about to happen. I may be terrified of certain things or I may have a generalized fear of everything.<br><br>
		Whenever I feel cheated, I get angry and resentful because I'm sensitive about being treated fairly.<br><br>
		The opinions of people bother me, which makes me a very private person indeed.<br><br>
		Because of my fear of being rejected or ridiculed, I am reserved and uneasy around people.

		<h4 style = "color:black"> Large crowds make me feel claustrophobic, and as a result, I deliberately avoid them.<br><br>
		I frequently require seclusion as well as solitary time to recharge my batteries.<br><br>
		I'm a quiet person who prefers to defer to others when it comes to running the show in gatherings. I'm a person who likes to keep things moving at a rapid pace. </h4>

		<h4 style = "color:black"> It is safe to say I you have a healthy dose of imagination, but I prefer to keep things grounded in reality wherever possible.<br><br>
		My interest in the arts is aroused, but I'm not completely engrossed in them.<br><br>
		I rarely freely express my feelings and aren't always aware of them.<br><br>
		In many situations, I may show a willingness to question established norms, authority, and conventional values.</h4>

	</center>
		<h4 style = "color:black"> I have a stereotypical view of others as being self-centered, cunning, and even dangerous.<br><br> 
		In new partnerships, I'm wary and reluctant to fully disclose who I am. <br><br>
		As long as someone is in need, I will come to their aid. If someone asks for an excessive amount of my time, I may feel that they 	are interfering with my personal time.<br><br>
		I dislike conflict, but if I believe in something enough, I will stand up for myself or make my point.<br><br> 
		I'm not one to put myself forward as superior than others, and I'm even less likely to brag about my achievements.<br><br> 
		I'm a sympathetic person most of the time, but I want to be objective when I can.</h4>

		<h4 style = "color:black"> Confidence in my ability to attain my goals is moderate.<br><br>
		I enjoy routines and timetables, and I'm well-organized to boot. I am likely to construct to-do lists and schedules frequently.<br><br>
		Despite being mostly responsible, I can be unreliable at times due to my average sense of duty and obligation.<br><br>
		Most of the time, I strive to do my best, but there are times when I am satisfied with simply doing the task at hand.<br><br>
		I have a strong sense of self-discipline and is able to stick with things until they are completed.<br><br>
		However, I am prone to becoming sidetracked and have a history of procrastinating.</h4>
